Throughout my first 2 years of university, I have gained and improved my programming skills.
From learning about object-oriented programming to data science, everything was new. 
I used these skills to analyze data in my biophysics class and visualize data in the current COVID-19 pandemic.
Whatever area of study you're in, programming and data science skills can be incredibly useful because they are so versatile in many contexts.
Especially in the pandemic, data science is being used constantly to keep track of statistics such as case rates, death rates, and vaccinations 
and communicate them effectively to the public.
