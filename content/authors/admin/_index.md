I'm an undergraduate engineering student specializing in cellular bioengineering. 
I chose to study biomedical engineering because I want to be able to apply engineering skills and concepts to the life sciences/medicine. 
Especially in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic, there is a clear need for medical innovation. 

In my free time, I love to read books, go on walks, and play music.
