Brain aneurysms, which are enlargements of weakened blood vessels in the brain, can cause severe negative 
neurological consequences if they rupture, including death. Usually, only those with a family history of aneurysms 
are regularly screened. For others, their aneurysm could rupture before detection. It is crucial to have early detection methods to 
minimize the impact on the lives of those affected. Nanotechnology is a new solution that is being explored. 
Nanorobots can be used to identify relevant chemical signals in the blood vessels that signal the location of a potential aneurysm.
Then, the nanosensor emits radio freqency signals sent to a wireless device so that the data can be tracked and analyzed. 
There are many benefits to this approach, including direct targeting for drug delivery and as a diagnostic tool. 
Although this is a very new area of research, it shows much promise.

This project included an informal proposal, memo, formal report, and poster presentation for the course 
"Technical Communication for Biomedical Engineering".
