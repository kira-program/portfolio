Given a case study of an elderly woman with a distal femur fracture, we were challenged with coming up with a solution for fracture fixation.
Fracture fixation is necessary to keep fragments together and in the right position for proper healing and swift recovery.
Especially in elderly patients, it is important for them to be able to perform load-bearing activities soon after surgery to minimize
any muscle atrophy or complications. We proposed an intramedullary nail as the best solution.

The intramedullary nail is a long metal rod that is inserted upward into the medullary cavity of the femur. 
To match the shape of the femur, the rod has a bent shape near the top. 
For the screws to be inserted, small holes are drilled into the nail, into the femoral head 
and on either side of the fracture site.Since the screws are interlocked in the nail, 
as well as the locking mechanism of the nail, movement of the screws is prevented. 

The major benefits of such a design are that it prevents fracture translation, provide stability in all directions,
resists torque and forces while sharing loads with the bone.The surgery needed to install this device is minimally invasive,
requiring only small incisions to insert the nail and screws.
