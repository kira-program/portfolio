For people with disabilities such as partial paralysis, even simple daily tasks such as twisting open a bottle cap can be arduous.
As a response to this issue, we designed a 3D-printable device to aid someone iini opening bottles. 
The "catch-and-pull" device is a device with a widening circumference lined with angled teeth designed 
to catch bottle caps of various sizes from a diameter of 2 cm to 7 cm. 
It also has a small protrusion at the tip to remove glass bottle caps.
This design is intuitive, portable, aesthetically pleasing, and compatible with different cap sizes.
