We implemented simple operations such as mirror, transform, posterize, clip, de-noising, weathering, block painting
, and rotation using Java. To compare how similar 2 images are, we implemented cosine similarity with a mathematical function 
using the grayscale version of both images. We also worked on a discrete fourier transform (DFT) and green screening.
