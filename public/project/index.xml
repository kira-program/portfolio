      <title>Graph Implementation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Given an interface for an unweighted directedgraph, we wrote 2 classes in Java that implement the interface: an adjacency list and an adjacency matrix.
Next, we implmented algorithms that may be used for social network analysis using the graph implementations.
Breadth first search (BFS) and depth first search (DFS) can both be used to traverse a graph.
Using these, it is possible to find the common upstream and downstream vertices of 2 vertices, the distance between 2 vertices, and
the graph diameter. We applied these algorithms to analysing a Twitter dataset, to find the common users that both user a and user b follow
and the minimum number of retweets needed for a message that user a tweets to appear in user b&amp;rsquo;s feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an extension of graphs, we added some subtypes to the virtual world, such as giraffes, cars, and cats that all have unique commands to control
their behaviour in the virtual world. This project was a fun way to think about code from a design point of view, and
to practice using subtypes and programming with existing interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Brain aneurysms, which are enlargements of weakened blood vessels in the brain, can cause severe negative
neurological consequences if they rupture, including death. Usually, only those with a family history of aneurysms
are regularly screened. For others, their aneurysm could rupture before detection. It is crucial to have early detection methods to
minimize the impact on the lives of those affected. Nanotechnology is a new solution that is being explored.
Nanorobots can be used to identify relevant chemical signals in the blood vessels that signal the location of a potential aneurysm.
Then, the nanosensor emits radio freqency signals sent to a wireless device so that the data can be tracked and analyzed.
There are many benefits to this approach, including direct targeting for drug delivery and as a diagnostic tool.
Although this is a very new area of research, it shows much promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project included an informal proposal, memo, formal report, and poster presentation for the course
&amp;ldquo;Technical Communication for Biomedical Engineering&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pfizer Thermal Shipper</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer have developed vaccines.
The Pfizer vaccine has to be kept in ultra-cold temperatures, so for its delivery the company developed a thermal shipper.
However, the design has major limitations, which were addressed in this group design project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our group&amp;rsquo;s final design features slideable trays in the box to contain vaccine vials and a door on the front of the box.
The top tray contains dry ice to keep vaccines cool, and the temperature sensor is embedded in the door.
We designed the mechanical, electrical, and software components to maintain thermal stability for keeping
the vaccine viable while allowing for greater access and modularity to smaller quantities of the vaccines
than the current thermal shipper.&lt;/p&gt;
